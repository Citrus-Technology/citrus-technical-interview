# Citrus Technical Interview

## Part 0a: Review product

Our platform is made up client facing applications using [React.js](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and an API built with [Nestjs](http://nestjs.com) based on the [Clean Architecture](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/), [SOLID principles](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/solid-principles/solid-typescript/), and [Domain-Driven Design](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/) best practices using TypeScript. These principles should help us isolate logic so that we can eventually migrate to a micro service to assist with scaling.
